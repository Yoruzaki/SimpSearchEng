# Text Preprocessing GUI

Text Preprocessing GUI is a simple Python application built using the Tkinter library that provides a user-friendly interface for preprocessing text data, deviding Docs and performing basic search operations.

## Features

- **Preprocess Corpus**: Select a corpus file and a stop words file, specify the number of documents to preprocess to devide the corpus file, and start the preprocessing process. The preprocessing involves removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, removing stop words, and lemmatization of words using custom rules.

- **Search Documents**: Search for a specific word in the preprocessed documents and retrieve documents based on their TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weights.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- ttkthemes
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
  I tried to do not use text processing libraries for better understanding the process of seaching how it work.
